## Key Features

### Sized and Fixed Inventories
Create inventories of variable size (like chests) or fixed size (like crafting tables and anvils), adapting to your project's needs.

### Full Customization
Control every aspect of your menus:

* **Interactive Items**: Define items with custom click logic for click events (left, right, middle).
* **Inventory Behaviors**: Assign actions for events like opening, closing, or general clicks within the inventory.
* **Flexible Patterns**: Design complex menus using character-based patterns to visually organize your items.

### Modular Design
The library is divided into modules that facilitate organization and scalability:

* **`layout`**: Contains the core logic for inventory construction and management.
* **`item`**: Handles the creation and manipulation of items used in inventories.
* **`plugin`**: Includes code examples that demonstrate the library's practical use. This module is ideal for learning the syntax and seeing how different concepts are applied.

## Developer Benefits

* **Rapid Development**: Drastically simplifies the menu creation process, allowing you to focus on your plugin's functionality.
* **Clean Code**: The fluid syntax results in more readable and maintainable code.
* **Great Potential**: Supports multiple inventory types and behaviors, making it a robust solution for a wide range of plugins.
